			<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
			<p>HTML stands for "hypertext markup language." It denotes how texts and images can be treated on a web browser, therefore marking them up.</p>
			<h2>Web pages, as a result, are basically Word documents...</h2>
			<h3>...only more interactive because they usually have JS and CSS as well as HTML.</h3>
			<p>What I just did, with the headings, is hierarchical, the different sizes denote different importances.</p>
			<hr>

			<p>What I did right above here is a horizontal rule, which was not assigned but I did anyway. It's a thematic break in an HTML page.</p>
			<div>Divs (use the &lt;div&gt; tag) are things I never really understood until recently. They're like paragraphs, but with no extra space above and below.</div>
			<div>Typically, with CSS, you can use divs to mark a block of text so you can apply a style or treatment to that text. See how there's no sapce here.</div>
			<hr>

			<p>Below is an unordered list of random things that interest me. If you go into the code, you'll also see how to mark specific words or phrases for emphasis or highlighting. 
			<span>You could use &lt;span&gt; as well, but this is quicker.</span>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Books</strong></li>
			<li><big>Memes</big></li>
			<li><small>Music</small></li>
			<li><em>Gaming</em></li>
			<li><u>Movies</u></li>
			<li><sub>D&D</sub> and <sup>Planeswalker</sup> (and other tabletop RPGs)</li>
			<li>And the following colors:
				<ul><li style="color:#FF0000">Red</li>
				<li style="color:#267F00">Green</li>
				<li style="color:#A300FF">Purple</li></ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>

			<p>You can also make ordered lists, where the bullets are replaced by numbers. You just use &lt;ol&gt; instead of &lt;ul&gt;. The &lt;li&gt; tag is still the same.</p>
			<h4>To Do List:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Do my homework.</li>
				<li>Do my work work because I have a job.</li>
				<li>Hang out with friends on Zoom.</li>
				<li>Play games probably.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr>

			<dl>
				<dt>Definition lists (using &lt;dl&gt;) also exist.</dt>
				<dd>The &lt;dd&gt; tag is for each list item.</dd>
				<dd>I've never seen anyone use them, but they'd be handy if you make a reference page or something.</dd>
			</dl>
			<hr>
			<p>To do quotes, <blockquote>You can use &lt;blockquote&gt; for a separate paragraph,</blockquote> Or <q>&lt;q&gt; for inline quotes.</q></p>
			<hr>

			<table border="2" width="750">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Skill</strong></td>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Proficiency in It</strong></td>	
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">Guitar:</td>
				<td width="50%">0/10, I've played for 11 years but have improved by 0% over those years.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">Photoshop:</td>
				<td width="50%">10/10, it's fun to use.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">Making Memes:</td>
				<td width="50%">11/10, no further questions asked.</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<hr>

			<p>The &lt;a&gt; anchor tag links to a website. Go on <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/">TheUselessWeb</a> or <a href="https://uwrejects.com">UWRejects</a> for a nice surprise or two.</p>
			<p>There's a lot to anchor tabs, including linking to local pages (<a href="index.html">index.html</a>, for example) and <a href="https://lolokaust.com">outside websites</a>.
			<p>You can also reference other types of resources, aside from hyperlinks. You can reference an email address (like <a href="mailto:lollo21@uw.edu">my email</a>, for example).
			<p>Finally, here's an image:</p>
			<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2012/03/04215201/03_26_07_KS_01.jpg" width="500" alt="The cherry blossoms at the University of Washington's Quadrangle (Quad), pink-tinted trees in the springtime with students walking around them." title="UW Cherry Blossoms">
			<p><small>Screen readers for the visually impaired read the alt attribute in an image tag, so it's generally a good idea to fill that in. If the image is purely decoration and not content, you can include a blank or null value (alt="") for your alt attribute, and screen readers will ignore the image. Additionally, when you hover your mouse over an image, it displays the text in the title attribute, so you may want to fill that in as well.</small></p>
