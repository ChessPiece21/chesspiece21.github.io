			<h1>My Name is Joe Lollo</h1>
			<p>And I'm taking B IMD 233, Web Programming, this quarter. My <a href="https://pronoun.is/they">pronouns are they/them</a>.</p>
			<h2>I might already know HTML...</h2>
			<h3>...but I'm taking this class to learn JS, CSS, and GitHub!
			<hr>

			<div>Divs (use the &lt;div&gt; tag) are things I never really understood until recently. They're like paragraphs, but with no extra space above and below.</div>
			<div>Typically, with CSS, you can use divs to mark a block of text so you can apply a style or treatment to that text. See how there's no sapce here.</div>
			<hr>

			<p>Below is an unordered list of fun facts about me. If you go into the code, you'll also see how to mark specific words or phrases for emphasis or highlighting. 
			<span>You could use &lt;span&gt; as well, but this is quicker.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>I'm a junior at UWB, majoring in <strong>Culture, Literature & the Arts</strong> and <strong>Media & Communication Studies</strong> with a minor in Computer Science</li>
				<li>I like to play music, and I've been <em>writing my own</em> lately.</li>
				<li>I'm also a huge gamer.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>

			<h4>To Do List:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Do my homework.</li>
				<li>Do my work work because I have a job.</li>
				<li>Hang out with friends on Zoom.</li>
				<li>Play games probably.</li>
			</ol>
			<hr>
			
			<table border="2" width="750">
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Skill</strong></td>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Proficiency in It</strong></td>	
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">Guitar:</td>
				<td width="50%">0/10, I've played for 11 years but have improved by 0% over those years.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">Photoshop:</td>
				<td width="50%">10/10, it's fun to use.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%">Making Memes:</td>
				<td width="50%">11/10, no further questions asked.</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<hr>
			
			<p>Finally, here's an image:</p>
			<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2012/03/04215201/03_26_07_KS_01.jpg" width="500" alt="The cherry blossoms at the University of Washington's Quadrangle (Quad), pink-tinted trees in the springtime with students walking around them." title="UW Cherry Blossoms">
			<p><small>Screen readers for the visually impaired read the alt attribute in an image tag, so it's generally a good idea to fill that in. If the image is purely decoration and not content, you can include a blank or null value (alt="") for your alt attribute, and screen readers will ignore the image. Additionally, when you hover your mouse over an image, it displays the text in the title attribute, so you may want to fill that in as well.</small></p>
